# Task Manager System

Task Manager is a simple yet powerful tool for project and task management. This pet project allows for efficient organization of tasks within different projects and teams.

## Features 
1. **Project and Team Creation**: Task Manager allows for the creation of separate projects and associating them with respective teams. This allows teams to work on projects separately. 

2. **Multi-team Collaboration on Tasks**: Different teams can work on tasks within a single project. Additionally, one team can work on tasks across multiple projects.

3. **Permission Control**: Task Manager allows for setting permission levels for users. This controls who has access to specific projects and tasks, ensuring security and confidentiality of information.
